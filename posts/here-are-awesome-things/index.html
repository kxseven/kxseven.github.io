I&#39;m an advocate of cloud computing and all of the benefits it can bring, 
specifically when adopting scalable IaaS offerings such as those provided by 
companies like AWS and Azure. There was originally a lot more to this - but
- fuck it; I love working with cloud technology and I can&#39;t stand it when I 
see behaviour that doen&#39;t put the customer first. I can only offer an apology
for the language.</code></pre></div><p>As I sit in the meeting with IaaS-vendor-who-shall-remain-nameless-but-we-all-know-who, I am confronted again with the realization that this vendor really isn&rsquo;t listening. It&rsquo;s a common problem with vendors that highlights a core need in our human behaviour; the need to feel &ldquo;heard&rdquo; or &ldquo;seen&rdquo; and belong to something bigger than themselves.</p><p>Technology empires and fortunes are predicated on this need. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons that Social Networks thrive and that online gatherings, be they on GitHub, reddit or 4chan, endure &ndash; they are places where like minded people go to speak and be heard by like-minded communities.</p><p>The meetings between Customer and Vendor are little different. In the best case; each party is present because they believe it&rsquo;s a mutually beneficial situation where each party will present a need (the customer needs to solve a challenge, the vendor needs to make a sale) in return for something the other values (revenue for the vendor, business value for the customer)</p><p>It should be a relatively straightforward exchange when there is a match and yet it seems to falter so often when it comes to Cloud. Why?</p><p>It&rsquo;s a failure to understand that the needs of Big Enterprise are not the same as other customers such as startups. The final target state is the same; to run your business by leveraging the benefits of the Cloud, but the starting points couldn&rsquo;t be more different.</p><p>A startup, or a company who starts in the Cloud is going to be aligned much closer with the operating model that adopting cloud services drives and more importantly there&rsquo;s a greater likelihood that there is no &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; to maintain or migrate from. These customers can fly without the need for &ldquo;checked bags&rdquo; because they dont have any baggage in the first place and when they do it&rsquo;s small pieces of luggage that fit into the overhead cabin will be carried by themselves to the plane &ndash; they can travel with only what they need in order to get to their desired destination</p><p>Not the case with Big Enterprise.</p><p>Big Enterprise knows it needs to travel by plane because everyone who does gets to their destination faster. Big Enterprise can&rsquo;t travel alone - the whole family will be going. Big Enterprise has packed everything because they don&rsquo;t yet know what they actually need and what they can leave behind. Big Enterprise has 200kg bags that need to be checked in and needs help lifting them. Big Enterprise has travelled by boat for years and has grown accustomed to the pace that such travel entails. Big Enterprise can no longer travel by boat. It&rsquo;s too slow and is percieved to be too expensive when compared to air travel.</p><p>The world of travel has changed though. Younger people no longer go to travel agents when booking their trip. They search for what they need, in general, pick the best cheapest option available to them and book it themselves.</p><p>Unfortunately that&rsquo;s not how Big Enterprise travels. Big Enterprise has tried to book it&rsquo;s own travel and had an awful experience or simply doesn&rsquo;t want to because of the scale involved. Big Enterprise has done what it has always done; it&rsquo;s picked up the phone, arranged a meeting with it&rsquo;s travel agent (read: &ldquo;IT Dept.&rdquo;) about it&rsquo;s desire to travel by plane.</p><p>This brings us neatly to &ldquo;Meeting #1: The Farce Awakens&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p><strong>BigE:</strong> We&rsquo;ve decide that we&rsquo;re going to start travelling by plane instead of by boat. Make it happen.</p><p><strong>TravelAgent:</strong> Absolutely. We&rsquo;ll just need more time, more people and more money.</p><p><strong>BigE:</strong> Why? Travelling by plane is meant to cost less!</p><p><strong>TravelAgent:</strong> It might cost less for the actual travel yes but we have no real capability in this domain; we lack the skills, experience and management tools for this. We will have to buy in these until we can do them for ourselves. We might even need a separate dedicated Flight Travel Team.</p><p><strong>BigE:</strong> That can&rsquo;t be right. I&rsquo;m going to call the airline and have them meet us to explain why this is all taking so much time, effort and cost</p></blockquote><p>The time between the first meeting and the next one can be weeks, months or sometimes years before the new provider finally gets to sit down with their customer. They important observation here is that by the time the meeting takes place Big Enterprise is already a customer. Until you book a flight - you simply don&rsquo;t exist to the airlines. The only way to engage with the service provider is to engage as a customer (traveller) of their service(s).</p><p>Queue up &ldquo;Meeting #2: A New Hype&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p><strong>BigE:</strong> So glad we&rsquo;re all here today. We have an existing Travel Agent. We want to travel by plane. Some of our employees have already travelled by plane and are here today.</p><p><strong>CloudAir:</strong> Fabulous! Tell us about where you want to travel! We have so many flights available that we&rsquo;re sure to have a combination that will get you to your destination at a cost that suits you.</p><p><strong>CloudAir:</strong> Here is a list of flights to popular destinations.<br><strong>CloudAir:</strong> Here is how to book one.<br><strong>CloudAir:</strong> Look at how much you can save on travel to this destination.</p><p><strong>BigE:</strong> That wasn&rsquo;t really the answer to my question. We need to be able to travel by plane.</p><p><strong>CloudAir:</strong> Here is a list of flights to popular destinations.<br><strong>CloudAir:</strong> Here is how to book one.</p><p><strong>BigE:</strong> That wasn&rsquo;t really the answer to my question. We need to be able to travel by plane.</p></blockquote><p>There are two failures here;</p><ul><li>CloudAir provided a response to the questions they&rsquo;ve been trained to answer (how to make a sale)</li><li>BigE presented their target state (&ldquo;We need to be able to travel by plane&rdquo;) as the question, rather than presenting their actual challenge (&ldquo;How do we get from where we are not to a place were we can travel by plane if we need to&rdquo;)</li></ul><p>On the vendor&rsquo;s part it&rsquo;s very much a &ldquo;Here are awesome things and here&rsquo;s how to use them&rdquo; mindset rather than &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a path from where you now are to where you want/need to be&rdquo;</p><p>The vendor simply has no way to meet the customer&rsquo;s real need. They don&rsquo;t provide any of those enabling services (training, skill development) because that&rsquo;s simply not the business they are in. They provide flights; Here are awesome flights and here is how to book one.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>Mostly nearly almost practically basically 80% of the way there never saved so much as a fucking sausage.</p>© 2019
