I&#39;m an advocate of cloud computing and all of the benefits it can bring, specifically 
when adopting scalable IaaS offerings such as those provided by by companies like AWS
and Azure. Any grumbling in this post represents my frustration with the failings of
organizations that give only lip-service to leadership principles and core values 
such as &#34;Customer Obsession&#34; [1]. </code></pre></div><p>Thought experiment: Lets revisit the previous definitions with AWS in mind:</p><blockquote><p>An abnormal growth of spend which tends to proliferate in an uncontrolled way and, in some cases, to metastasize (spread).</p><p>A term for undesired patterns in which technology spreads without control and can invade nearby functions. AWS consumption can also spread to other parts of the organization through the upper and senior management.</p></blockquote><p>I would challenge that the biggest risk to your business operated on cloud as you grow is not your data or your customers walking out the door but rather failing to observe the uncontrolled growth and spread of technology that will later become so integral to it&rsquo;s operation that you will be unable to remove it without &ldquo;killing the patient&rdquo;
Why do we seem to treat cloud infrastructure vendors different to the traditional hardware vendors such as Cisco, HP, Dell, etc? It&rsquo;s because we do not see them as a <em>&ldquo;vendor&rdquo;</em></p><p>Traditional vendor relationships generally have an ebb and flow;</p><ul><li>You buy something from the vendor based on the sales material and projected use of it&rsquo;s functions</li><li>You install, configure, run and operate it</li><li>You realise your support has expired</li><li>You get a call from the vendor offering you discount on new business</li><li>You resist</li><li>You eventually give in, because you need it for your business</li><li>You get some business value from the transaction (discounts, new features, etc)</li><li>And off we go all over again&hellip;</li></ul><p>What&rsquo;s interesting about this pattern is that business have developed habits around it; with each layer of the organization having some involvement in the relationship and each layer getting something out of it;</p><ul><li>There&rsquo;s the technical teams that use the tech, adopt it&rsquo;s features and drive the need for more consumption or reject further adoption if it&rsquo;s unsuitable</li><li>There&rsquo;s the supporting functions of the organization that will run and manage the tech, gain value from it&rsquo;s ability to enable or reject further adoption if it&rsquo;s unstable or unmanageable</li><li>There&rsquo;s management who will manage the spend against business value to be extracted now and in future or add friction against further adoption if it&rsquo;s not favorable to the bottom line</li></ul><p>The key observation is that in the traditional vendor relationship, the power and control to affect that (vendor) relationship lie within equivalent domains of responsibility in the organization itself. There&rsquo;s a seat for each at the decision table, with power equivalent to their ability to impact the business</p><ul><li>Management affects business value and strategy</li><li>Supporting functions (e.g. IT) enable the business</li><li>Development functions deliver on the business goals</li></ul><p>Adopting cloud infrastructure and consuming IaaS though turns this completely on it&rsquo;s head. Almost all of the power shifts to the development function.</p><p>The developer team(s) select the technology, provision and configure it as well as generally operate it. Supporting functions don&rsquo;t undertake their normal responsibility (of providing support) because it&rsquo;s all alien and unmanageable to them. Traditional management functions are bypassed because they add no value to the interaction between developer and API. You can&rsquo;t apply a nicely curated Active Directory Group Policy to it because it&rsquo;s not a Windows Server and what isn&rsquo;t seen by management, can&rsquo;t be managed.</p><p>The undesired growth begins.</p><p>Adoption drives further consumption, delivering success after success.
Consumption drives expansion into more (IaaS) resource types, often with their own variant of access management.
Spend is now uncontrolled.
Identity and access management are now uncontrolled.
Inventory is now uncontrolled.</p><p>If you are consuming public cloud IaaS in a large organization I&rsquo;m sure this feels all too familiar.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a startup. We don&rsquo;t have this problem at all! We have spend alerts and good IAM hygiene&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Can you build an accurate inventory?</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of course. We just hit the API and there it is&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>What about the inventory at the date of your last bill?</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have detailed billing enabled. We have granular data on what is provisioned&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Nope.</p><p>That is granular data on what you have been charged for. That is not the same. Can you break down your costs well enough to understand <em>&lsquo;When&rsquo;</em> your costs flex or more importantly <em>&lsquo;Why&rsquo;</em>?</p><p>We get detailed billing from our phone companies. Do we blindly trust that data?</p><p>Hells no!</p><p>Why do we behave differently when it&rsquo;s cloud? Is it the scale of having to trawl through all that data or that the team who trigger the spend being completely disconnected from whomever is receiving the bill? What is it about this particular challenge that causes us to view the likes of AWS and Azure through a different lens?</p><p>Is it that we seem it more as consuming something we already own and have paid for rather than value we have yet to &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; (and then pay for) every time we hit that API? Visibility of the the cost has been disconnected from the actual purchase - there&rsquo;s no longer any friction preventing the spread/adoption.</p><p>How much more would we buy if we could shop by hitting the API (moving items from the shelf to our trolley) with no friction (having to stop and pay, possibly questioning our decision and the value of the items we plan to purchase)?</p><p>Oh wait. Amazon just did this. I guess we&rsquo;ll find out.</p><p>Now it&rsquo;s too late.</p><p>The (AWS) bill is huge and while we&rsquo;re delivering success after success it&rsquo;s at what cost? Are we so tightly coupled to a single cloud provider that a regional service outage (I&rsquo;m looking at you AWS us-east-1) can derail our global business availability? Can we even move to another cloud provider if we wanted to? Can I separate resources that deliver core business functions (e.g. inventory metrics that enable the shopping cart) from operational capabilities (e.g. uptime metrics that represent availability)?</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I know what we&rsquo;ll do! We&rsquo;ll put everything into containers and then we won&rsquo;t have to care about all the layers underneath.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>I do love this one.</p><p>This is the IT equivalent of repressing a traumatic experience. We haven&rsquo;t dealt with what&rsquo;s actually wrong &ndash; we&rsquo;re treating the symptoms instead.</p><p>By the time we realize and acknowledge we&rsquo;re terminally ill it will be too late and the only course of action left will be drastic, brutal and at best extend our (business) lifespan by a few years.</p><p>Early detection works. It can save your life. It can also save your business.</p><p>[1]: <a href=https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles>AWS Leadership Principles</a></p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>Mostly nearly almost practically basically 80% of the way there never saved so much as a fucking sausage.</p>© 2019
